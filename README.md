# Project Overview
This project applies **scenario-based analytics** to evaluate potential **Family Planning (FP) expansion strategies** across geographic units. Using simulated scale-up scenarios, the analysis assesses **trade-offs between cost, coverage, equity, and operational feasibility,** enabling donors and policymakers to make informed investment decisions.
The Power BI dashboard translates complex programmatic data into **clear, donor-ready insights and visuals** that support strategic planning, prioritization, and resource allocation for FP scale-up.

# Analytical Purpose
Family Planning investments require balancing multiple, often competing objectives:
•	Expanding coverage efficiently
•	Ensuring equitable access across populations
•	Managing program costs
•	Maintaining operational feasibility within health systems
This project addresses the need for a **decision-support tool** that allows stakeholders to **compare alternative FP expansion scenarios** and understand the implications of each option before committing resources.

# Project Objectives
-	Simulate multiple FP expansion scenarios across regions
- Quantify **cost, coverage, equity, and feasibility outcomes** for each scenario
-	Compare scenarios using standardized metrics
-	Highlight trade-offs and opportunity costs
-	Produce **donor-ready summaries and interactive visuals** to support scale-up decisions

# Data Inputs (Simulated & Assumed)
The analysis is based on simulated or modeled datasets typically used in FP planning, including:
-	Baseline FP service coverage
-	Target population estimates
-	Unit costs of FP service delivery
-	Health system and operational readiness indicators
-	Geographic and demographic attributes

⚠️ _Data used for this project is assumed to be aggregated, anonymized, and simulated for strategic planning rather than individual-level analysis._

# Data Processing & Transformation
Using **Power Query, SQL, Python and Excel** the following steps were applied:
-	Harmonization of indicators across regions
-	Standardization of units (costs, percentages, population counts)
-	Creation of scenario-specific variables
-	Normalization of indicators to enable cross-scenario comparison
-	Validation checks for internal consistency
